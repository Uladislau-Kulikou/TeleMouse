# TeleMouse
### Control your PC with gestures using a webcam

TeleMouse was created mainly for web surfing, but it’s flexible enough to be used in many other scenarios where a mouse is needed. It doesn’t aim to replace a keyboard entirely, but it already supports a range of built-in key combinations through gestures.

It’s especially useful in situations where using a physical mouse is inconvenient — for example, when you’re leaning back in your chair or lying in bed and want to switch a series on Netflix or scroll through YouTube. Or even when your hands are dirty (e.g. eating chips or chicken) and you don’t want to touch your devices. Most users will find their own use case.
